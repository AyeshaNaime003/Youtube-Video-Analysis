# YouTube Dataset Explanatory Analysis

This Colab notebook provides an explanatory analysis of the YouTube dataset. The [youtube dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/youtube-new) was loaded from Kaggle using the Kaggle API method:
<br><code>kaggle datasets download -d datasnaek/youtube-new</code><br>. To use this notebook, make sure to download the Kaggle API file (`kaggle.json`) from Kaggle and upload it to the Colab file space.

## Data Loading

The first step in this notebook is to load the YouTube dataset from Kaggle using the Kaggle API method. This ensures that we have the most up-to-date version of the dataset for analysis.

## Data Preprocessing

After loading the dataset, we perform data preprocessing: fixing the data types of columns and handling missing values. 

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA section of this notebook focuses on exploring the YouTube dataset to uncover trends and insights. We analyze various aspects of the data, such as views, likes, dislikes, and comments, to identify patterns and relationships. Through visualizations and statistical analysis, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of the dataset.

Please note that this notebook assumes basic familiarity with Python, data preprocessing, and data visualization techniques.
